# Overview
This is a brief expansion of the ideas started in 

The plan is to draw together conjectures and thoughts that are not quite substantial enough for a paper, but do suggest a constructive way to think about Deep Learning.

1. Summary of 
2. Matched filtering as a good model for CNNs
3. Activation functions as noise suppression

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
\\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\)
